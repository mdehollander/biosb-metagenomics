## FastQ format

First let's take a look at the data

There is a pattern that is repeated every 4 lines. This is the [FASTQ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format). It follows this structure:

|Line|Description|
|----|-----------|
|1|Always begins with '@' and then information about the read|
|2|The actual DNA sequence|
|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes the same info in line 1|
|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|

The fourth line shows the quality of the read. To make the sequence and the qaility align well, the numerical score is converted into a code where each individual character represents the numerical quality of an individual nucleotide, following this scheme:

!!! done "FASTQ quality encoding"
            Quality encoding: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJ
                            |         |         |         |         |
            Quality score:    01........11........21........31........41

NextSeq and NovaSeq data often contains poly-g tails. Let's check if this also is the case for our simulated input

    $ zcat /data/reads/sample_0.fq.gz | grep -E "GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG$"

This search does not retun any hits. But often the end of the sequences contain stretches of poly-g. Below is an example how poly-g tails look like in Novaseq data.

## FastQC reports

Let's check the quality of the data with FastQC before quality filtering:

    mkdir fastqc_untrimmed_reads
    fastqc --threads 8 /data/reads/sample_0.fq.gz -o fastqc_untrimmed_reads/

!!! question Exercise
    Open the FastqQC report `fastqc_untrimmed_reads//sample_0_fastqc.html`

## Quality trimming and filtering

Because NovaSeq and NextSeq from Illumina contain often poly-g tails, it is good to use a trimming tool that can detect poly-g tails. Fastp can do that. We keep the defaults like they are, but specify we have interleaved input data. In case you have R1 and R2 file for each sample, you need to enable adapter detection with the `--detect_adapter_for_pe` flag. Execute fastp with this command:

    fastp -i /data/reads/sample_0.fq.gz \
          --stdout \
          --interleaved_in \
          -q 25 \
          --cut_front \
          --cut_tail \
          --cut_mean_quality 25 \
          -l 51 \
          --thread 16 \
          --trim_poly_g > sample_0.trim.fastq

Now make a FastQC report again, to see the results of the quality filtering.

    mkdir fastqc_trimmed_reads
    fastqc --threads 8 sample_0.trim.fastq -o fastqc_trimmed_reads/

!!! question "Exercise" 
    - Are there any adapter sequences detected?
    - Take a look at the html report

### Alternative trimming with bbduk

Alternative trimming with bbduk. Compare poly-g tail filtering, adapter trimming.

    bbduk.sh in=/data/reads/sample_0.fq.gz  \
        out=sample_0.trim.bbduk.fastq.gz \
        interleaved=true \
        trimpolygright=1 \
        qtrim=w trimq=20 \
        minlength=51 \
        ref=/data/databases/nextera.fa.gz ktrim=r \
        stats=bbduk.stats \
        t=16

!!! question Exercise
    - Create also an FastQC report for the trimming with bbduk 
    - What are differences between filtering with fastp and bbduk?

## Remove PhiX sequences

    bbmap.sh ref=/data/databases/phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz \
             in=sample_0.trim.fastq \
             interleaved=true \
             outu=sample_0.nophix.fastq.gz \
             outm=sample_0.phix.fastq.gz \
             t=4


!!! question "Exercise" 
    - How many PhiX sequences are detected?
    - From which samples?
    - Can you confirm the sequences are PhiX?
    - The input data was simulated without adding any PhiX. How could there still PhiX sequences being detected?

## From one sample to many

!!! question "From one sample to many"

    Now do a QC for all samples. You can use a for loop for that. For example, fastp can be run like:

        for file in data/reads/*.gz; do \
            sample=$(basename ${file} .fq.gz);
            fastp -i $file --stdout --interleaved_in -q 25 --cut_front --cut_tail --cut_mean_quality 25 -l 51 --thread 16 --trim_poly_g > $sample.trim.fastq;
        done

## Quickly check what is in this metagenome

### Sendsketch
    sendsketch.sh --in=sample_0.nophix.fastq.gz threads=4 address=refseq

### Sourmash
**Note**: The sourmash database is not included in the VM because it can't be downloaded at the moment. There is an [overview of all prepared databases](https://sourmash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/databases.html) The [51 kmer set of representative genomes](https://farm.cse.ucdavis.edu/~ctbrown/sourmash-db/gtdb-rs207/gtdb-rs207.genomic-reps.dna.k51.lca.json.gz) would be a good one to use when available

Now try it locally, using sourmash. First create a signature for a sigle sample.

    sourmash sketch dna -p scaled=10000,k=51 sample_0.nophix.fastq.gz -o sample_0.sig  

Find what is in this metagenome using the `gather` command:

    sourmash gather sample_0.sig /data/databases/gtdb-rs207.genomic-reps.dna.k51.lca.json.gz

### Kraken
Compare with kraken

First setup the database

    mkdir kraken_db
    tar zxvf /data/databases/k2_standard_08gb_20220926.tar.gz -C kraken_db

Now run kraken2

    kraken2 --db kraken_db/ --threads 16 --output sample_0.kraken --report sample_0.kraken.report --gzip-compressed --use-names sample_0.nophix.fastq.gz

!!! question 
    Take a look at the `sample_0.kraken.report`. What are the differences in classification compared to sendsketch and sourmash?
